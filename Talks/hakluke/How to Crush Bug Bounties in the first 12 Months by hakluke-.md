#### ==Avoid of FOS (Fear Of Starting):==
- Bug bounties too hard
- There is no way to find bugs
- ... etc
=> 100 % you can succeed earning money on 1 year. All this feature, is just on your heard.
=> Forget your fears and just DO IT. (ignore all the fear)
=> No ONE is cares succeed or not - You have the choice to Keep leaving in this Low level of life of change it forever

#### ==SO HERE WE GO:==
-	Log out of YouTube, Netflix, Turn your phone off
-	Create a space where you can focus and eliminate all distractions
-	Take a Deep breath and just Start

1. __Focus on education (bug bounty is really different from pentesting)__
	1. The Bug Hunter's Methodology by @Jhaddix
	2. The Web Application Hacker's Handbook 2 (bible of web application testing)
		1. Use it as a reference 
	3. PentesterLab 
	4. Follow hackers on all the platforms, examples
		1. Jhaddix
		2. nahamsec
		3. Stok
		4. naffy
		5. insiderPhd
		6. codingo
		7. farah
		8. live overflow
		9. ed overflow
		10. tomnomnom
		11. hukluke
		12. .... etc etc etc
2. __Consistency and habits__
	1. Small incremental points everyday
	2. Planning a learning habits for learning bug bounty 
3. __Automation__
	1. Automate tool can help you discover more bugs
	2. Automate systems can generate a passive income
	3. The longer we spend on automation, the more money you earn
	4.  Spend half of time with manual automation and the other half in building automating systems
4.  __What exactly do I automate ?__
	1.  Firstly, think about data storage
		1.  Organize, scalable, and easily searched way to store all the data captured during the automation
			1.  You can use slack API
			2.  Text file
	2.  what need to notified by:
		1.  Batch notification (once per day)
		2.  One notification contain all found subdomains
		3.  Heavily curate the notification
			1.  Actual vulnerability not any Recon results
			2.  If you use __Slack__:
				1.  channel to Recon (mute the channel)
				2.  channel to Vulnerability (with notification settings)
	3.  Automating your recon:
		1.  writing __wrappers__ around existing tools to fit your need
			1.  For example: Python wrapper which calls the amass binary and then process and stores the results ... etc
		2.  Build your own tools/stuff:
			1.  For example:
				1.  Subdomain enumeration
				2.  ... etc
5.  __Automate your vulnerability scanning:__
	1.  nuclei project discovery (highly recommended)
	2.  Scan for custom things you designed yourself
	3.  Add threading - improve your speed (require system with high resource)
	4.  Scale out using multiple systems
		1.  Kubernetes
		2.  message brokers (Redis and rabbitmq)
		3.  axiom 'github' by pry0cc (highly recommended)
6.  __Collaboration & Community:__
	1.  your collaboration is mutual beneficial
	2.  Agree on the terms of collaboration from the beginning
		1.   what will the split if you make money?
		2.   who's responsible doing what?
		3.   how much information be shared together?
	3.   Join conversation on Twitter, discord
	4.   Share tips, Write-ups .. etc
7. __knowledge__:
	1. Fundamentals (roots of the tree) _Important_
		1. Basic networking
		2. How http works?
		3. How to use Bash?
		4. How web application work?
		5. How the internet works?
	
			
8.  __Hack where is less computations:__
	1.   Be the first where any program is opened
	2.   Use automation to detect new targets
	3.   Detect change in your existing targets using automation (DNS record ... etc)
	4.   Run a web crawler (such Burp) with the same settings every time => you'll notice and find any new end points suddenly appears
	5.   Creativity is a KEY!
9. __IMPORTANT__
	1.  To be successful in bug bounty you need to be super switched on and creative (you have a brain need to be used):
	2. eat great food
	3.  Exercising regularly 
	4.  sleeping enough
	5.  _Health before anything else_
	6.  Read inspiring books
